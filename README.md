# Library-management-SQLServer
This project aims to develop a library management system for a public library which can help in 
tracking of the library resources. As a library consists of different types of materials, managing 
everything via traditional methods would be lengthy and can be faulty as well. Using a Relational 
database at this scenario is the perfect fit as it can add many other facilities. For this database system 
to be in a proper form so that data integrity is maintained we must go according to the guidelines.

In this Library Database we have 7 entities and many attributes within,

1. Material
2. Borrow
3. Author
4. Catalog
5. Genre
6. Member
7. Staff

# Files
This repository contains several files that are integral to the setup and execution of a database management system for a library. Here's a brief overview of each file:

SatyamSingh_Report_CS504_002.pdf: A comprehensive report detailing the project work.
LibraryScript.sql: This SQL file is used to create the database, tables, and schemas, and then populate the tables with data.
README.txt: This text file contains details of the files and instructions for running the code.


Instructions to Execute the Queries
Setting up the Database: Open the database LibraryScript.sql file in any SQL editor. 
Executing the Queries: Select all contents and run it to create the database, tables, schemas, and insert the data into the tables.
