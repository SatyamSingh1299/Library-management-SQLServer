# Library-management-SQLServer
This project aims to develop a library management system for a public library which can help in 
tracking of the library resources. As a library consists of different types of materials, managing 
everything via traditional methods would be lengthy and can be faulty as well. Using a Relational 
database at this scenario is the perfect fit as it can add many other facilities. For this database system 
to be in a proper form so that data integrity is maintained we must go according to the guidelines.

In this Library Database we have 7 entities and many attributes within,

1. Material
2. Borrow
3. Author
4. Catalog
5. Genre
6. Member
7. Staf
